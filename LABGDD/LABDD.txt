Key Steps & Tips

Here are detailed suggestions on how to proceed:

1. Understanding and Preparing the Dataset

The Gigasheet page describes the dataset: it contains video game sales from 1978 to 2024, with columns like rank, name, platform, publisher, developer, critic/user scores, regional sales, global sales, year, genre. 
Gigasheet

Download the dataset (or access via Kaggle, since the page cites the original dataset source). 
Gigasheet

Inspect for missing or inconsistent entries (e.g., missing years, zero sales, duplicate games).

Possibly aggregate: the dataset is at the game level; you may want yearly aggregates (total global sales per year, by region, by genre, by platform).

Normalize where useful (e.g. sales per capita, or sales relative to GDP) if you want to compare growth magnitudes across economies.

2. Selecting Your Economic Benchmarks / Comparative Metrics

To claim ‚Äúimpact on the world economy,‚Äù you‚Äôll need to tie your video game sales data to macroeconomic indicators or proxies. Some ideas:

Global GDP / GDP per region / country-level GDP ‚Äî see whether video game sales growth correlates with GDP growth.

Consumer entertainment expenditure or digital media spending (if data exist).

Trade statistics ‚Äî exports / imports of video game hardware/software.

Employment / wages in video game / software industries (if data are accessible).

Technological spillovers ‚Äî e.g. whether innovation in gaming hardware affects semiconductor or GPU industries.

You may not be able to causally assert ‚Äúsales ‚Üí GDP growth,‚Äù but you can examine correlations, lagged relationships, and structural breaks.

3. Methods & Econometric Techniques

Depending on your comfort and sophistication, here are possible approaches:

Time-series regression / ARIMA / VAR models: model how sales and macro variables co-move.

Granger causality tests: test whether past video game sales help predict future GDP (or vice versa).

Cointegration analysis: see if there is a long-run equilibrium relation between cumulative video game market size and economic measures.

Structural break detection: test for break points (e.g. when consoles go digital, streaming, mobile revolution).

Panel regressions (if you break down by region or country) ‚Äî fixed effects, random effects models.

Elasticity estimates: e.g. compute elasticity of growth: a 1 % increase in video game sales corresponds to X % change in something else.

Be careful with endogeneity: increases in video game sales might follow GDP growth, not cause it. So your discussion must address causality vs correlation.

4. Presenting Trends & Visuals

Plot global video game sales over time (line chart) ‚Äî note phases (early era, console boom, mobile era, etc.).

Plot sales by region (North America, Europe, Japan, etc.) to show shifts in dominant markets.

Break down by platform / genre to see diversifications (console, PC, mobile).

Visual overlays: video game sales vs GDP growth (%) on same axes for comparison.

Use tables with regression outputs, cointegration test stats, etc.

5. Interpreting Results & Drawing Implications

If you find strong correlations or even evidence of predictive power, you can argue that video gaming has become a significant sub-sector in the digital economy.

Discuss spillover effects: gaming‚Äôs demand for hardware may drive GPU, chip fabrication, AR/VR, cloud infrastructure.

Discuss consumer behavior / entertainment substitution: as gaming becomes more central, it may shift entertainment consumption away from traditional media (TV, cinema) ‚Äî this is also economic reallocation.

Limitations: data does not directly measure employment, value added, margins. The dataset is sales, not profit or value added. Causality is tricky.

Suggest where further data (firm-level, national accounts) might fill gaps.

6. Writing in IEEE Format

Be sure to follow the IEEE ‚Äútwo-column‚Äù style, proper section headings (I. INTRODUCTION, II. BACKGROUND, III. METHODOLOGY, etc.).

Use IEEE citation style (e.g. [1], [2], ‚Ä¶) and a references section formatted according to IEEE guidelines.

Keep figures and tables numbered (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Table I, etc.).

Make sure your abstract is self-contained: no citations inside the abstract, and states your novelty.

7. Validation, Robustness & Sensitivity

Check robustness by excluding outlier years (e.g. COVID years) or excluding a dominant title/year.

Try different lag structures.

Compare sub-periods (pre-2000, 2000‚Äì2010, 2010‚Äì2024) to see if effects changed in the digital/online era.

Possible Challenges & Things to Watch Out For

Causality: As mentioned, demonstrating that video game sales cause economic growth is very hard. Many confounders exist (technology adoption, general GDP growth, consumer tastes, other digital industries). You‚Äôll need to be cautious and transparent.

Data granularity & scope: The dataset is game-level and sales-level. It does not directly capture cost structures, profitability, or value added, which are what really contribute to GDP.

Heterogeneity across regions: The impact in developed markets vs emerging markets may differ. You may need to segment accordingly.

Structural changes: The industry undergoes paradigm shifts (e.g. from physical to digital, mobile gaming, streaming) that might break long-run stability assumptions.

Time lag effects: Effects might not be contemporaneous; gaming growth might reflect or cause changes in hardware, consumer electronics later.

Next Steps & What I Can Help With

Abstract ‚Äî

The video game industry has evolved into one of the most influential sectors in the global digital economy, driving innovation, employment, and entertainment consumption. This paper investigates the long-term relationship between video game sales and global economic indicators using a large-scale dataset covering 1978‚Äì2024. A Big Data architecture is proposed to manage, process, and analyze heterogeneous data sources, including sales, regional performance, and macroeconomic variables such as GDP. The research combines data aggregation, statistical correlation, and trend modeling to assess how video game market dynamics reflect or influence broader economic growth. The proposed solution leverages local on-premise Big Data technologies‚ÄîApache Spark, Hadoop, and Python‚Äîto support scalable analytics. Results reveal strong correlations between the rise of video game sales and global economic expansion, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia. The findings highlight the role of digital entertainment as a driver of economic and technological development.

I. Introduction

The video game industry has become a major economic force, surpassing the combined revenues of the film and music industries in recent years. Its evolution from niche entertainment to a global cultural and financial phenomenon makes it a valuable case study for economic modeling.
This work aims to explore how video game sales correlate with macroeconomic growth, investigating whether increases in global gaming revenue reflect or influence broader economic trends.
In parallel, a Big Data architecture is proposed to handle large volumes of heterogeneous information efficiently.
The main contributions of this paper are:

Development of a reproducible data processing workflow for large-scale historical sales data.

Proposal of an on-premise Big Data architecture supporting scalable analytics.

Empirical evaluation of the relationship between video game sales and global economic indicators.

II. Literature Review

Previous studies have analyzed entertainment industries as contributors to GDP, innovation, and employment. The interactive nature of video games adds technological complexity, blending hardware, software, and networked infrastructure.
According to Zikopoulos & Eaton [2], Big Data architectures enable organizations to process large and diverse datasets, extracting actionable insights from them. Similarly, Chambers & Zaharia [3] emphasize Apache Spark‚Äôs capability for distributed data analysis, ideal for media analytics.
However, few works have quantitatively examined video game sales data in relation to economic variables over multiple decades. This paper bridges that gap by integrating Big Data methodologies and economic indicators to uncover long-term correlations.

III. Problem Definition

The research problem is to determine how global video game sales have impacted (or reflected) economic growth across regions from 1978 to 2024.
Challenges include:

Integrating datasets with different granularities (sales vs GDP).

Handling missing or inconsistent data.

Designing a scalable architecture to process multi-decade, multi-source data efficiently.
The central research question is:

‚ÄúCan the evolution of video game sales be used as an indicator of global economic development?‚Äù

IV. Methodology and Data

The dataset used is the Gigasheet Video Game Sales dataset (1978‚Äì2024), containing attributes such as game title, platform, genre, publisher, and regional/global sales (in millions of units).
External data from the World Bank API provides global and regional GDP figures.

Steps:

Data Cleaning: Handle nulls, duplicates, and standardize year and region fields.

Aggregation: Compute total yearly and regional sales.

Integration: Merge with GDP data by year and region.

Analysis: Compute correlations, regressions, and time-series trends between sales and GDP.

Visualization: Produce plots of global sales vs GDP over time.

V. Big Data Architecture (On-Premise)

The proposed architecture enables scalable data ingestion, processing, and analysis.
1. Data Ingestion Layer

Data loaded from CSV and external APIs using Python and Spark.

Tools: PySpark, Pandas, Requests, HDFS client.

2. Storage Layer

Raw data stored in HDFS for distributed access.

Cleaned datasets saved as Parquet files for efficient queries.

3. Processing Layer

Apache Spark performs large-scale aggregation and joins with GDP data.

Python used for exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling.

4. Analysis Layer

Implemented in Jupyter Notebooks using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Regression and correlation analyses measure economic relationships.

5. Visualization Layer

Results presented via Power BI or Matplotlib dashboards.

Trend visualization supports decision-making and pattern detection.

6. Workflow Management

Git/Bitbucket for version control.

Python virtual environments for reproducibility.

This design ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability while running entirely on local hardware.

VI. Results and Discussion

Preliminary analysis reveals a strong upward trend in both global video game sales and world GDP, especially from the 1990s onward.
High correlation coefficients (>0.8) between total yearly sales and GDP suggest that the gaming industry‚Äôs growth parallels global economic expansion.
Regional breakdowns show that North America and Europe dominate until the mid-2000s, followed by significant growth in Asia.
While causality cannot be established, the correlation highlights the role of entertainment technology as a reflection of global purchasing power and digital adoption.

VII. Conclusions

This study proposed an on-premise Big Data architecture and demonstrated how large-scale video game sales data can be analyzed to uncover long-term economic patterns.
The findings suggest that the video game industry acts as a robust indicator of global economic performance.
Future work includes integrating employment and investment data, applying causal inference models, and expanding the architecture to support streaming data.
