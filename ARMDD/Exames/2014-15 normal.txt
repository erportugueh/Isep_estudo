Resolutions for the 2014-15 Exam

Grupo I - Modelação Dimensional

1. Data Mart Design (Kimball Methodology):

Facts:

Number of minutes played, goals scored/suffered, fouls committed/suffered, yellow cards, red cards, successful passes, failed passes, and assists for each player.

Dimensions:

Player Dimension: Player ID, Full Name, Nickname, Position, Address, Postal Code, Last Contract Date, Contract Duration, Acquisition Value, Release Clause Value, Current Club.

Club Dimension: Club ID, Name, Address, Postal Code, Corporate ID, Foundation Date.

Match Dimension: Match ID, Round Number, Weekend Number (1-5), Month, Year.

Competition Dimension: Competition ID, Description (e.g., Primeira Liga, Taça de Portugal), Number of Rounds, Number of Clubs, Amateur/Professional Indicator.

Time Dimension: Year, Month, Day, Weekend Number.

Granularity:

At the player statistics level per match and competition.

Example Schema:

Fact Table:

Fact_Player_Stats: Player ID, Club ID, Match ID, Competition ID, Time ID, Minutes Played, Goals Scored, Goals Suffered, Fouls Committed, Fouls Suffered, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, Successful Passes, Failed Passes, Assists.

Dimensions:

Dim_Player: Player attributes.

Dim_Club: Club attributes.

Dim_Match: Match attributes.

Dim_Competition: Competition attributes.

Dim_Time: Time attributes.

2. Changes to Support Specific Queries:

Add a bridge table to track players who did not participate in specific matches or competitions:

Bridge_Player_NonParticipation: Player ID, Match ID, Competition ID, Indicator of Non-Participation.

Update the fact table with participation indicators to facilitate queries about matches and players where participation did not occur.

Analyses:

Query the bridge table for players not participating in specific matches or competitions.

Cross-check with other dimensions and fact tables as needed.

Grupo II - Múltipla Escolha

1. Dimensional Model Objectives:

Answer: All the presented reasons (simplicity, performance, flexibility).

2. BUS Architecture (Kimball):

Answer: The data warehouse results solely from the integration of atomic data marts.

3. Currency Analysis in Data Warehouses:

Answer: Any of the presented approaches can be used (columns for each currency, uniform conversion, or exchange rate fact table).

4. Optimization Strategy Using Indexes:

Answer: All presented statements are correct.

5. MOLAP Characteristics:

Answer: Queries are slower compared to Relational OLAP.

Grupo III - Verdadeiros ou Falsos com Justificação

1. Agreement Between Kimball and Inmon on Atomic Data:

Answer: True.

Justification: Both architectures prioritize atomic-level data for flexibility and detailed analysis.

2. Fact Table Composition:

Answer: True.

Justification: Fact tables always contain a composite primary key, business measures, and optionally degenerate dimensions.

3. SCD Type 3 for Rare Dimension Changes:

Answer: False.

Justification: SCD Type 3 is suitable for tracking a limited history of changes, but SCD Type 2 is typically used for low-frequency updates with full history.

Grupo IV – Questão de Desenvolvimento

Data Extraction Strategies:

Full Extraction:

All data is extracted from source systems regardless of changes.

Example: Copying entire tables for archival purposes.

Incremental Extraction:

Only data modified since the last extraction is retrieved.

Example: Using timestamps to extract updated records.

Hybrid Strategy:

Combines full extraction for certain data sets and incremental extraction for others.

Example: Periodic full backups with daily incremental updates for transactional data.
