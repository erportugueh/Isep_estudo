Resolutions for the 2013-14 Exam

Grupo I - Modelação Dimensional

1. Data Mart Design (Kimball Methodology):

Facts:

Total goals scored during stoppage time (after 45 or 90 minutes).

Total fouls suffered in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd quarter of an hour, by half, for a specific player in a match.

Dimensions:

Player Dimension: Player ID, Name, Nickname, Position, Address, Postal Code, Last Contract Date, Contract Duration, Acquisition Value, Release Clause Value, Current Club.

Club Dimension: Club ID, Name, Address, Postal Code, Corporate ID, Foundation Date.

Match Dimension: Match ID, Round Number, Weekend Number (1-5), Month, Year, Games on Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.

Event Dimension: Event ID, Description (e.g., foul committed, foul suffered, goal scored, missed penalty, etc.), Infraction Indicator.

Time Dimension: Day, Hour, Minute, Second.

Granularity:

At the event level for each player per match.

Example Schema:

Fact Table:

Fact_Events: Player ID, Club ID, Match ID, Event ID, Time ID, Minutes Played, Goals Scored, Fouls Suffered, Fouls Committed, Yellow Cards, Red Cards, Assists, Successful Passes, Failed Passes.

Dimensions:

Dim_Player: Player attributes.

Dim_Club: Club attributes.

Dim_Match: Match attributes.

Dim_Event: Event attributes.

Dim_Time: Time attributes.

2. Additional Requirements for Player Abilities:

Create a new dimension:

Dim_Abilities: Player ID, Ability Type (e.g., free-kick taker, penalty taker, dribbler), Proficiency Level.

Update the Fact_Events table to include a reference to Dim_Abilities where necessary.

Grupo II - Múltipla Escolha

1. Invalid Operation in Data Staging Area:

Answer: Analysis of data by users.

2. Characteristics of a Fact Table:

Answer: Contains all characteristics mentioned in the options.

3. Index Types:

Answer: All statements are false.

4. Aggregation Creation Strategies:

Answer: Any of the described forms.

5. OLAP Operations:

Answer: Drill-down consists of performing analyses at a lower level of detail.

Grupo III - Verdadeiros ou Falsos com Justificação

1. Surrogate Keys in Dimensions:

Answer: False.

Justification: Surrogate keys are used for maintaining data integrity and supporting slowly changing dimensions, not just for performance.

2. Static Data Extraction Strategy:

Answer: False.

Justification: Static extraction can involve incremental strategies and other approaches besides brute force.

3. Data Warehouse Aggregation Optimization:

Answer: True.

Justification: Introducing aggregations requires the creation of new fact tables to store these summaries.

Grupo IV – Questão de Desenvolvimento

Monetary Value Strategies in Dimensional Modeling:

Uniform Currency Conversion:

Use a standard currency (e.g., Euros) and convert all values to this currency during the ETL process.

Include Exchange Rates in Fact Tables:

Maintain a fact table containing daily exchange rates for each currency pair.

Include these rates in joins when performing analysis.

Store Values in Multiple Currencies:

Add columns for different currencies in fact tables, allowing users to choose which currency to analyze.
