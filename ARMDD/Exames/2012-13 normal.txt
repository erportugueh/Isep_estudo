Resolutions for the 2012-13 Exam

Grupo I - Modelação Dimensional

1. Data Mart Design (Kimball Methodology):

Facts:

Total expenses incurred per salesperson during trips, categorized by type (e.g., meals, flights, taxis).

Total days spent on trips per salesperson.

Dimensions:

Salesperson Dimension: Salesperson ID, Name, Address, Postal Code, Mobile Number, Date of Admission, Last Year Sales Volume.

Section Dimension: Section ID, Description, Creation Date, Closure Date (if applicable), Number of Salespersons, Section Leader.

Client Dimension: Client ID, Name, Address, Postal Code, Country.

Expense Type Dimension: Expense Type ID, Description (e.g., meals, flights).

Trip Dimension: Trip ID, Salesperson ID(s), Client ID, Trip Date, Number of Days, Initial Budget.

Currency Dimension: Currency Code, Name.

Time Dimension: Day, Month, Year.

Granularity:

At the individual expense level per trip and salesperson.

Example Schema:

Fact Table:

Fact_Expenses: Trip ID, Salesperson ID, Expense Type ID, Currency ID, Expense Value, Expense Date, Expense Time.

Dimensions:

Dim_Salesperson: Salesperson attributes.

Dim_Section: Section attributes.

Dim_Client: Client attributes.

Dim_Expense_Type: Expense type attributes.

Dim_Trip: Trip attributes.

Dim_Currency: Currency attributes.

Dim_Time: Time attributes.

2. Currency Conversion Requirements:

Create a fact table to store exchange rates:

Fact_Exchange_Rates: Currency Pair, Conversion Date, Conversion Rate.

Update the fact table Fact_Expenses to allow analyses in multiple currencies by joining with the exchange rate fact table.

Grupo II - Múltipla Escolha

1. Data Staging Area Characteristics:

Answer: All the statements are correct (no end-user access, no report storage, ETL-only operations).

2. Fact Type for Inventory:

Answer: Can be added along all dimensions except date/time.

3. Referential Integrity for Fact Loading:

Answer: Check for surrogate keys before fact table loading.

4. Partitioning Strategies:

Answer: Accessing data in multiple partitions is not always faster than accessing a single table.

5. MOLAP Characteristics:

Answer: MOLAP is not suitable for handling very large data volumes.

Grupo III - Verdadeiros ou Falsos com Justificação

1. Relevance of Granularity:

Answer: False.

Justification: Granularity also impacts business understanding and query performance, not just technical design.

2. Mini-Dimension Use:

Answer: True.

Justification: Mini-dimensions are used to store attributes such as flags and text, improving fact table performance.

3. Aggregation Storage Techniques:

Answer: True.

Justification: Aggregations can be stored in pre-computed tables or calculated on the fly depending on query needs.

Grupo IV – Questão de Desenvolvimento

Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Techniques:

Type 1:

Overwrite old data with new data.

Example: Updating a salesperson's address without keeping history.

Type 2:

Create a new record for each change, maintaining full history.

Example: Storing each version of a salesperson's address.

Type 3:

Maintain limited history by adding new columns for changes.

Example: Keeping only the current and previous salesperson addresses.
